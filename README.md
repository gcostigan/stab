# Goal
Stabilize a model rocket in-flight using 3-D printed fins, servos, on-board sensors, and an arduino.

# Progress
We have split the required goal of the project into three parts.
* Stab-I    =>  Control Roll
* Stab-II   =>  Control Pitch
* Stab-III  =>  Control Yaw

# STAB-I
We decided to use an raspberry pi zero on-board to track the flight path, and we used a pair of servos to control two added fins. We have created a prototype board for housing the electronics in fritzing.

We are currently experimenting with simulating the rocket in a rocket simulation software, [OpenRocket](http://openrocket.sourceforge.net/). This open source software should allow us the calculate an approximate for variables such as coefficient of drag, coefficient of pressure, and many more. And screenshot of our rocket is Shown below
